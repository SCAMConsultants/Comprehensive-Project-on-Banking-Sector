# Comprehensive-Project-on-Banking-Sector
The project will cover some of the major banking operations, starting from maintaining a proper employee base to targetting customers through advertisement and from protecting our bank from credit card frauds, to giving life protection to our customers through insurance.


#Comprehensive Project on Banking Sector
SCAM Consultants has decided to take up various aspects of banking sector- namely HR, Marketing, Insurance and Credit Risk and analyse the same.
We wanted to cover an end-to-end process but altered it suiting our vision as well as the data available. We have taken 4 datasets on the above-mentioned areas from Kaggle and will analyse them to report our findings.


1)	Dataset 1
Banking Dataset-Marketing Targets ( Banking dataset of different customers to predict if they will convert or not)
https://www.kaggle.com/prakharrathi25/banking-dataset-marketing-targets
Description: Term deposits are a major source of income for a bank.
A term deposit is a cash investment held at a financial institution. Your money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time, or term.
The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their
customers such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing, and digital marketing.
Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people. However, they require huge investment as large call centers are hired to actually execute these campaigns. Hence, it is crucial to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call.

2)	Dataset 2
HR Analytics-Job Change of Data Scientists (Predict who will move to a new job)
